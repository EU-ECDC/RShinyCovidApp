# RShinyCovidApp
The RShiny app is designed to make three features accessible to the user: 1) Forecasts: Current and previous four-week ahead forecasts of the number of cases in each region (and age group when available), 2) Predictors: The risks of secondary transmission and importations estimated by the model, and 3) Scenarios: The impact of changes in transmission, be it due to more infectious variants, changes in behaviour, or NPIs. These changes in transmission represent the potential impact of control measures on transmission, and should be interpreted with caution in a constantly changing epidemiological situation (impacted for example by behaviour, adherence..). Similarly, this model only considers the epidemiological impact of NPIs, the social or economic costs of different control measures is not considered in this analysis.

The analysis, code, Shiny App and model were developed and implemented by Alexis Robert, Lloyd Chapman, Adam Kucharski, and Sebastian Funk (Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School and Hygiene and Tropical Medicine), and Bastian Prasse, Frank Sandmann, Rene Niehus, and Rok Grah (ECDC)
