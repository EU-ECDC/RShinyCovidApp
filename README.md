# RShiny App: Analysis of subnational COVID-19 outbreak risk in the EU/EEA in the vaccine era

To run the Shiny app locally, install the `shiny` package, set the working directory to this repository, and run `shiny::runApp("Scripts_RShiny/")`. You will need to have the packages listed in the first lines of `ui.R` (`shiny`, `leaflet`, `dplyr`, `sf`, `ggplot2`, and `surveillance`) installed on your computer. 

The file "Rshiny App user guide" contains the user guide of the Shiny app.

This repository contains four R scripts and three data files (all located in the folder `Scripts_RShiny`).
* `Scripts_RShiny/output_model_FR.RDS`, `Scripts_RShiny/output_model_CZ.RDS`, and `Scripts_RShiny/output_model_IT_total.RDS` are output files generated by the backend scripts. They contain simulation sets, predictors values, maps, and model output generated in each country.
* `Scripts_RShiny/ui.R` is a script defining the user interface of the shiny app. It describes how the buttons, options, and plots integrated in the Shiny app are arranged and labeled.
* `Scripts_RShiny/server.R` defines the server logic of the shiny app, i.e it links changes in the user interface to the functions implemented in `function_shiny.R` and `function_server.R`.
* `Scripts_RShiny/function_shiny.R` contains the different functions used to generate the figures integrated in the Shiny app.
* `Scripts_RShiny/function_server.R`: contains a function wrapping `plot_time_series()` depending on the selected inputs.
